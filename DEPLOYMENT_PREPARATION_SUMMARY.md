## Verification Results

### Pre-deployment Verification
All checks passed when running `node verify-deployment.js`:
- ✅ Essential deployment files present
- ✅ Dockerfile content verified
- ✅ docker-compose.yml content verified
- ✅ Nginx configuration verified
- ✅ Environment configuration verified
- ✅ Deployment scripts verified

### Deployment File Verification
All checks passed when running `node test-deploy.js`:
- ✅ All required files exist
- ✅ docker-compose.yml has correct content
- ✅ nginx.conf has correct content

## Deployment Readiness

### [x] Files Ready
- All deployment files are present and correctly configured
- Docker configuration verified
- Nginx configuration verified
- Environment file created with placeholder values

### [x] Scripts Ready
- Deployment scripts verified
- Verification scripts tested and working

### [ ] Credentials Required
Before deployment, you must:
1. Update the [.env](.env) file with your actual TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
2. Update the [.env](.env) file with your actual OPENAI_API_KEY
3. Verify SSH access to the target server (root@31.97.173.218)

## Deployment Instructions

Once you have updated the credentials, you can deploy using:

### For Linux/Mac:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### For Windows:
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the application is running correctly:
1. Check Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check application logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Verify health endpoint: `curl https://anna.floripa.br/health`
