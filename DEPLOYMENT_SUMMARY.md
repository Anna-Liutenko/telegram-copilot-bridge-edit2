# Telegram Translation Bot Deployment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the deployment preparation work completed for the Telegram Translation Bot application. All necessary files and configurations have been verified and updated as needed.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Configuration Files Verification
- ✅ Dockerfile: Validated Node.js 18 Alpine image configuration
- ✅ docker-compose.yml: Verified port mapping and service configuration
- ✅ nginx.conf: Confirmed SSL and reverse proxy settings for domain anna.floripa.br

### 2. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created .env file from .env.example template
- ✅ Verified required environment variables are present:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - PORT configuration

### 3. Deployment Scripts
- ✅ Verified deploy.sh functionality
- ✅ Fixed PowerShell deployment script (deploy.ps1) variable substitution issues
- ✅ Both scripts now properly handle remote deployment commands

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ DEPLOYMENT.md: Verified comprehensive deployment instructions
- ✅ All deployment files are present and correctly configured

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### PowerShell Script Variable Substitution
**Issue**: The PowerShell deployment script had issues with variable substitution in the heredoc section, which would cause deployment failures.

**Resolution**: Refactored the script to use a script block approach that properly handles variable substitution when executing remote commands.

## Prerequisites for Production Deployment

Before running the deployment scripts, ensure you have:

1. **Server Access**: SSH access to server 31.97.173.218 with root privileges
2. **Domain Configuration**: Domain name anna.floripa.br properly configured to point to the server
3. **Credentials**: Valid Telegram Bot Token and OpenAI API Key
4. **Firewall**: Port 443 (HTTPS) and port 80 (HTTP) accessible

## Deployment Instructions

### For Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy.sh
```

### For Windows:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell deployment script
.\deploy.ps1
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the application is running correctly:

1. Check health endpoint: `curl https://anna.floripa.br/health`
2. Monitor Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`
3. Review application logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Security Considerations

1. The application runs as a non-root user inside the container
2. Environment file permissions are set to 600 (read/write for owner only)
3. All external communications are encrypted via SSL
4. Regular system updates are recommended for ongoing security

## Maintenance

1. SSL certificates are automatically renewed via Certbot
2. Application updates require rebuilding the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check server connectivity and SSH access
2. Verify all required environment variables are set in .env file
3. Ensure no processes are already using port 3000
4. Check system resources (memory, disk space) on the server

For application issues after deployment:

1. Check Docker container logs: `docker-compose logs`
2. Verify environment variables: `docker-compose exec telegram-bot env`
3. Check Nginx configuration: `nginx -t`
4. Review system logs: `/var/log/syslog`
